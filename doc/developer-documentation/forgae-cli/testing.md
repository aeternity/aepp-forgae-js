# forgae test

## Run unit tests

```text
forgae test
```

The **test** command help developers run their unit tests for aeternity projects. The command executes the tests scripts that are located in the **test** folder of your aeternity project. Additional **--path** param is available, which can specify the path to the tests

### Special global variables and modules available for unit tests

forgae exposes special convenience global variables and functions that can be used in the unit tests.

#### Wallets

Global wallets array is available to be used by the developer. Wallets has 10 items all representing the 10 `forgae node` wallets created on the node start. Every item has the structure of:

```text
{
    "publicKey": "ak_fUq2NesPXcYZe...",
    "secretKey": "7c6e602a94f30e4e..."
}
```

This structure makes it very convenient for creation of SDK client objects

**Example**

```text
const host: "http://localhost:3001/",
const internalHost: "http://localhost:3001/internal/",

// Create client objects
owner = await Ae({
    url: host,
    internalUrl: internalHost,
    keypair: wallets[0],
    nativeMode: true,
    networkId: 'ae_devnet',
    compilerUrl: 'http://localhost:3080/'
});

nonOwner = await Ae({
    url: host,
    internalUrl: internalHost,
    keypair: wallets[1],
    nativeMode: true,
    networkId: 'ae_devnet',
    compilerUrl: 'http://localhost:3080/'
});
```

#### minerWallet

Similarly to `wallets` there is a global variable `minerWallet` representing the wallet of the node miner following the same structure.

**Example**

```text
// Create client objects
miner = await Ae({
    url: host,
    internalUrl: internalHost,
    keypair: minerWallet,
    nativeMode: true,
    networkId: 'ae_devnet',
    compilerUrl: 'http://localhost:3080/'
});
```
